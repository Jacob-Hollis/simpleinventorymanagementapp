## Overview

This is a simple web app that simulates an inventory management system. I built it as a refresher on Vue, and to experiment with the new Vueify data tables found in their Labs experimental playground.

```
npm install
npm install vue-router@4
npm install vueify --save-dev
npm install --save axios vue-axios
```

## Run dev environment
```
npm run serve
```

## Compile for production
```
npm run build
```

## Fix files

npm run lint
```
